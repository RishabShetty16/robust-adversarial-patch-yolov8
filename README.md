# Robust Adversarial Patch Attack for YOLOv8

## Overview

This repository implements a modular and research-oriented framework for developing robust adversarial patch attacks against YOLOv8.

The project is being built incrementally, with each milestone introducing a new component of the adversarial attack pipeline while maintaining a clean and extensible architecture.

The long-term objective is to generate physically robust adversarial patches capable of suppressing object detection under real-world transformations.

# Current Milestone

## Commit 12: Detector-Aware Suppression Loss

### Objective

Implemented a detector-aware optimization objective for adversarial patch training.

### Changes

- Added `AttackTarget` module to extract target class confidence scores from YOLOv8 predictions.
- Implemented `person_suppression_loss()` to minimize person detection confidence.
- Replaced the placeholder baseline loss with detector-aware suppression loss.
- Added confidence statistics during training:
  - Mean Target Confidence
  - Maximum Target Confidence
  - Minimum Target Confidence
- Added gradient flow verification.
- Added patch clamping after each optimizer step to keep pixel values within the valid image range `[0,1]`.
- Added checkpoint saving and loss history logging.
